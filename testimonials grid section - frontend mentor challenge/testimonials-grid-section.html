            <p class="text-md font-bold text-zinc-300 mx-4 pb-7">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

        <p  class="text-md font-bold text-zinc-400 mx-4 pb-7">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my devolopment experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
